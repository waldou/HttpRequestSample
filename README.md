HttpRequestSample
=================

HttpRequestSample its an example Android application to show how you can
replicate the same login process that is done through a browser
to www.colourlovers.com and get private user data.

The objective is to demostrate that its possible to do an app of
a website or service without the need of a public API available
to us.

The approach was to use basic web scraping techniques to initiate the
log in flow and then process raw HTML data to extract the values we want.

Just add your www.colourlovers.com username and password in the
HttpRequestTask.java file to test it.
